In JavaScript, both the document and window objects are essential for interacting with the web page, but they serve different purposes and have distinct roles:

window Object************************
Represents the browser window or tab.
It's the global object, meaning global variables and functions are properties of window.
Provides methods and properties related to the browser environment (e.g., alert(), setTimeout(), location).

document Object**********************
Represents the HTML document loaded in the window.
It's a property of the window object.
Provides methods and properties for accessing and manipulating the DOM (e.g., getElementById(), createElement()).

***Example Usage:***
// Accessing the window object
window.alert("Hello, World!");

// Accessing the document object
document.getElementById("myElement").textContent = "Hello, DOM!";
